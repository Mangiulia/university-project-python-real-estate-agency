# Real Estate Company Database Management Project 
This project aims to efficiently manage a real estate company's database, facilitating real estate transactions between clients and owners through agents across the country. The main goal is to provide a centralized and easily accessible solution for all parties involved in real estate transactions, thereby improving customer experience and agent efficiency.
# Table Descriptions
1. Agents Table - Contains information about the company's real estate agents, including name, surname, rank, commission percentage, hiring date, and other relevant details. This table is used in my code to manage and analyze the performance of agents in terms of the number of completed transactions and the revenues generated.
2. Clients Table - Contains details about clients who wish to buy or sell properties through the real estate company. Information includes name, surname, address, phone number, and other relevant details. My code uses this table to manage and analyze client preferences and requests, as well as to identify trends in their behavior.
3. Owners Table - Contains information about property owners who have entrusted the real estate company with managing and promoting their properties. Details include the owner's name, address, contact information, and other relevant details. This table is used to monitor and efficiently manage relationships with owners and the portfolio of properties managed by the company.
4. Contracts Table - Contains information about contracts signed between clients and owners, mediated by the company's agents. Contract details, such as contract value, signing date, and other relevant information, are used to analyze agent performance and assess the company's effectiveness in closing transactions.
5. Properties Table - Contains details about properties available for sale or rent, including address, area, price, construction date, and other relevant information. These data are used to identify trends in the real estate market and provide clients with up-to-date information about available properties.
6. Rank Table - Contains details about the different ranks of agents within the real estate company, such as rank, standard commission associated with each rank, and other relevant details. This table is used to analyze and evaluate agent performance according to their rank, as well as to adjust commission strategies to maximize efficiency and profitability.
# Elements Used in Code
- Use of Pandas Package -
I use the Pandas library to load and manipulate CSV files, performing various data processing operations such as grouping, aggregation, and filtering.
- Data Analysis -
Through the code, I perform data analysis to identify trends and patterns in customer behavior, agent performance, and the real estate market in general.
- Clustering -
Using clustering algorithms like K-means, I attempt to identify groups or segments of clients or properties to offer personalized recommendations and improve marketing and sales strategies.
- Multiple Regression -
Through multiple regression, I identify relationships and correlations between different variables (such as property price and its characteristics) to better understand the factors that influence prices and make more accurate predictions.
- By combining data from these CSV files and using algorithms and methods from the Pandas, scikit-learn, and statsmodels packages, my project for the "software packages" course aims to provide a deeper and more accurate understanding of the real estate market and improve property trading and management processes.
